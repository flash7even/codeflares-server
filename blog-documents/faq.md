##### There are other oj and contest platforms, why Codeflares?
Codeflares is neither an online judge, nor a contest platform. Rather, it's an automated offline training
platform to help the contestants keep track of their progress statistics. It also suggest them the most relevant problems
and algorithms they need to focus now based on their problem solving history and current skill. So you can see, our purposes
are very different thant other online judges and contest platforms. To know more about our features please have a
look on our guidelines.

##### Why there's no features like oj & contest hosting platform?
There are already a lots of online judges and contest hosting platforms like codeforces, codechef, atcoder, uva, spoj and etc.
Most of them are extremely good and lots of contestants are using them.
So we personally don't think there's any point of working on a similar platform like those.

##### How effective is the rating system that exists in Codeflares?
Codeflares rating system is only effective for your training progress. As our rating system is completely based on your
offline problem solving history, technically it has no significant value to judge your actual problem solving skill. But if
you are being completely honest, the rating system and our skill generation model can help you to progress more faster by
assisting you with a proper training model and providing you a lot of statistics.
